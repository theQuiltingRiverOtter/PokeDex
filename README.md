#PokeDex

This is an application that I used to practice working with APIs, Axios, Express, and EJS.  It gets a response from the Pokemon API and returns an object with the name, type, abilities, and an image for the pokemon. You can access the basic three pokemon from the navbar or search for a pokemon by name or ID.
